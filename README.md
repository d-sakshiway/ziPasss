This is description of this project.
Project Features
The project has just been started and is planning to implement a couple of features including :
  > host an event , so attendees can buy pass from there
  > buy or get passes for hosted events
  > renew that pass for food coupons if that's offered for any given event
Project Vision :
> to scale up this project for college authorities to adopt it, so that the event being organised at college can incorporate this and reduce the chaos of pass generation, verification during entry, etc.
> 
Project deployment :
it has been deployed on neoX testnet
